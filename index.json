Data teams struggle with fragmented development environments, complex resource management, inconsistent monitoring, and cumbersome manual scheduling processes. These issues lead to lengthy development cycles, inefficient resource utilization, reactive troubleshooting, and difficult-to-maintain data pipelines. These challenges are especially critical for enterprises processing terabytes of data daily for business intelligence (BI), reporting, and machine learning (ML). Such organizations need unified solutions that streamline their entire analytics workflow.\nThe next generation of Amazon SageMaker combined with Amazon EMR in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio addresses these pain points through an integrated development environment (IDE) where data workers can develop, test, and refine Spark applications in a consistent environment. Amazon EMR Serverless reduces the cluster management burden by dynamically provisioning resources based on workload requirements, and integrated monitoring tools help teams quickly identify performance bottlenecks.\nIntegration with Apache Airflow through Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA) provides robust scheduling capabilities, and the pay-only-for-resources-used model delivers significant cost savings.\nIn this post, we demonstrate how to develop and monitor a Spark application using existing data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) with SageMaker Unified Studio.\nSolution overview This solution uses SageMaker Unified Studio to execute and monitor Spark applications, highlighting integration capabilities. We demonstrate the following key steps:\nCreate an EMR Serverless compute environment for interactive applications using SageMaker Unified Studio Create and configure Spark applications Use TPC-DS data to build and run Spark applications using Jupyter notebooks in SageMaker Unified Studio Monitor application performance and schedule periodic runs with Amazon MWAA integration Analyze results in SageMaker Unified Studio to optimize workflows Prerequisites To follow this tutorial, you need the following requirements:\nAn AWS account – If you don\u0026rsquo;t have an account yet, you can create one A SageMaker Unified Studio domain – For instructions, see Create an Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio domain – quick setup A demo project – Create a demo project in your SageMaker Unified Studio domain. For instructions, see Create a project. For this example, we choose a profile with All capabilities in the project configuration section Adding EMR Serverless to compute Complete the following steps to create an EMR Serverless compute environment for building Spark applications:\nIn SageMaker Unified Studio, open the project you created as a prerequisite and choose Compute Choose Data processing, then choose Add compute Choose Create new compute resources, then choose Next Choose EMR Serverless, then choose Next Enter a name for Compute name For Release label, choose emr-7.5.0 For Permission mode, choose Compatibility Choose Add compute The EMR Serverless application initialization process takes a few minutes. After creation is complete, you can view the compute in SageMaker Unified Studio. The above steps illustrate how you set up an Amazon EMR Serverless application in SageMaker Unified Studio to run interactive PySpark workloads. In the following steps, we will build and monitor the Spark application in the interactive JupyterLab workspace.\nDeveloping, monitoring, and debugging Spark applications in Jupyter notebooks In this section, we build a Spark application using the TPC-DS dataset in SageMaker Unified Studio. With Amazon SageMaker Data Processing, you can focus on transforming and analyzing data without having to manage compute capacity or open-source applications, saving time and reducing costs.\nSageMaker Data Processing provides a unified development experience from Amazon EMR, AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, and Amazon MWAA in the same notebook and query interface. You can automatically provision capacity on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or EMR Serverless. Autoscaling rules manage changing compute demands to optimize performance and execution time.\nImplementation steps: After completing the previous preparation steps, go to SageMaker Studio and open your project Choose Build, then choose JupyterLab The notebook takes about 30 seconds to initialize and connect to the workspace Under the Notebook category, choose Python 3 (ipykernel) In the first cell, next to Local Python, select the dropdown menu and choose PySpark Choose the dropdown menu next to Project.Spark and select the EMR-S Compute compute Run the following code to develop your Spark application. This example reads a 3 TB TPC-DS dataset in Parquet format from a public S3 bucket: spark.read.parquet(\u0026#34;s3://blogpost-sparkoneks-us-east-1/blog/BLOG_TPCDS-TEST-3T-partitioned/store/\u0026#34;).createOrReplaceTempView(\u0026#34;store\u0026#34;) When the Spark session starts and execution logs begin to appear, you can explore the Spark UI and driver logs to debug and troubleshoot your Spark program. The following screenshot shows an example of the Spark user interface. The following screenshot shows an example of driver logs. The following screenshot shows the Executors tab, providing access to driver and executor logs. Use the following code to read additional TPC-DS datasets. You can create temporary views and use the Spark UI to view the files being read. Refer to the appendix at the end of this article for details on how to use TPC-DS datasets in your buckets. spark.read.parquet(\u0026#34;s3://blogpost-sparkoneks-us-east-1/blog/BLOG_TPCDS-TEST-3T-partitioned/item/\u0026#34;).createOrReplaceTempView(\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;) spark.read.parquet(\u0026#34;s3://blogpost-sparkoneks-us-east-1/blog/BLOG_TPCDS-TEST-3T-partitioned/store_sales/\u0026#34;).createOrReplaceTempView(\u0026#34;store_sales\u0026#34;) spark.read.parquet(\u0026#34;s3://blogpost-sparkoneks-us-east-1/blog/BLOG_TPCDS-TEST-3T-partitioned/date_dim/\u0026#34;).createOrReplaceTempView(\u0026#34;date_dim\u0026#34;) spark.read.parquet(\u0026#34;s3://blogpost-sparkoneks-us-east-1/blog/BLOG_TPCDS-TEST-3T-partitioned/customer/\u0026#34;).createOrReplaceTempView(\u0026#34;customer\u0026#34;) spark.read.parquet(\u0026#34;s3://blogpost-sparkoneks-us-east-1/blog/BLOG_TPCDS-TEST-3T-partitioned/catalog_sales/\u0026#34;).createOrReplaceTempView(\u0026#34;catalog_sales\u0026#34;) spark.read.parquet(\u0026#34;s3://blogpost-sparkoneks-us-east-1/blog/BLOG_TPCDS-TEST-3T-partitioned/web_sales/\u0026#34;).createOrReplaceTempView(\u0026#34;web_sales\u0026#34;) In each notebook cell, you can open Spark Job Progress to view the stages of jobs sent to EMR Serverless for a specific cell. You can see the completion time for each stage. If errors occur, you can check the logs, making troubleshooting more seamless. Since the files are partitioned based on date key columns, you can observe that Spark runs tasks in parallel to read the data. 8. Next, get counts by date keys on data partitioned by time key using the following code:\nselect count(1), ss_sold_date_sk from store_sales group by ss_sold_date_sk order by ss_sold_date_sk Monitoring jobs in Spark UI In the Jobs tab of the Spark UI, you can view a list of completed or running jobs, with the following information:\nAction that triggered the job Execution time (e.g., 41 seconds, but times will vary) Number of stages and tasks — in this example, 2 stages and 3,428 tasks You can select a job to see more details, especially about the stages. Our job has two stages; a new stage is created each time there is a shuffle. We have one stage to read data from each initial dataset, and one stage for aggregation. In the next example, we run some TPC-DS SQL queries used for performance evaluation and benchmarking:\nwith frequent_ss_items as (select substr(i_item_desc,1,30) itemdesc,i_item_sk item_sk,d_date solddate,count(*) cnt from store_sales, date_dim, item where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk and d_year in (2000, 2000+1, 2000+2,2000+3) group by substr(i_item_desc,1,30),i_item_sk,d_date having count(*) \u0026gt;4), max_store_sales as (select max(csales) tpcds_cmax from (select c_customer_sk,sum(ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) csales from store_sales, customer, date_dim where ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_year in (2000, 2000+1, 2000+2,2000+3) group by c_customer_sk) x), best_ss_customer as (select c_customer_sk,sum(ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) ssales from store_sales, customer where ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk group by c_customer_sk having sum(ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) \u0026gt; (95/100.0) * (select * from max_store_sales)) select sum(sales) from (select cs_quantity*cs_list_price sales from catalog_sales, date_dim where d_year = 2000 and d_moy = 2 and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and cs_item_sk in (select item_sk from frequent_ss_items) and cs_bill_customer_sk in (select c_customer_sk from best_ss_customer) union all (select ws_quantity*ws_list_price sales from web_sales, date_dim where d_year = 2000 and d_moy = 2 and ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and ws_item_sk in (select item_sk from frequent_ss_items) and ws_bill_customer_sk in (select c_customer_sk from best_ss_customer))) x You can monitor Spark jobs in SageMaker Unified Studio in two ways. Jupyter notebooks provide basic monitoring, showing real-time job status and execution progress. For more detailed analysis, use the Spark UI. You can check specific stages, tasks, and execution plans. The Spark UI is particularly useful for troubleshooting performance issues and optimizing queries. You can track the expected number of stages, running tasks, and detailed duration of each task. This comprehensive view helps you understand resource usage and track job progress at a detailed level.\nIn this section, we explained how you can use EMR Serverless compute in SageMaker Unified Studio to build interactive Spark applications. Through the Spark UI, interactive applications provide detailed task-level status, I/O and shuffle information, as well as links to corresponding task logs directly from the notebook, enabling a seamless debugging experience.\nCleanup To avoid ongoing charges in your AWS account, delete the resources you created in this tutorial:\nDelete connections Delete EMR jobs Delete EMR output S3 buckets Delete Amazon MWAA resources such as workflows and environments Conclusion In this post, we demonstrated how the next generation of SageMaker, combined with EMR Serverless, provides a powerful solution for developing, monitoring, and scheduling Spark applications using data in Amazon S3. The integrated experience significantly reduces complexity by providing a unified development environment, automatic resource management, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities through the Spark UI, while maintaining cost efficiency with the pay-as-you-use model. For enterprises, this means faster time to insights, improved team collaboration, and reduced operational overhead, allowing data teams to focus on analytics rather than infrastructure management.\nTo get started, explore the Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio User Guide, set up a project in your AWS environment, and discover how this solution can transform your organization\u0026rsquo;s data analytics capabilities.\nAppendix In the following sections, we discuss how to run scheduled workloads and provide details about the TPC-DS dataset for building Spark applications using EMR Serverless.\nRunning scheduled workloads In this section, we deploy JupyterLab notebooks and create workflows using Amazon MWAA. You can use workflows to orchestrate notebooks, querybooks, and many other things in your project repository. With workflows, you can define a set of tasks organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that can run on a schedule you define. Implementation steps:\nIn SageMaker Unified Studio, choose Build, and under Orchestration, choose Workflows Choose Create Workflow in Editor You will be directed to the JupyterLab notebook with a new DAG named untitled.py created in the /src/workflows/dag folder\nRename this notebook to tpcds_data_queries.py\nYou can reuse the existing template with the following updates:\na. Update line 17 with the schedule you want your code to run on b. Update line 26 with your NOTEBOOK_PATH. This path should be in src/\u0026lt;notebook_name\u0026gt;.ipynb. Note that the dag_id name is auto-generated; you can name it as per your requirement. 5. Choose File and Save notebook To test, you can trigger a manual workload run 6. In SageMaker Unified Studio, choose Build, then under Orchestration, choose Workflows. 7. Choose your workflow, then choose Run. You can monitor job success on the Runs tab. To debug notebook jobs by accessing the Spark UI in the Airflow job console, you must use EMR Serverless Airflow Operators to submit jobs. The link is available on the Details tab of the query. This option has key limitations: it is not available for Amazon EMR on EC2, and SageMaker notebook job operators do not work.\nYou can configure the operator to create one-time links to the application UI and Spark output logs by passing enable_application_ui_links=True as a parameter. After the job starts running, these links are available on the Details tab of the corresponding task. If enable_application_ui_links=False, the links will appear but in a grayed-out state.\nMake sure you have emr-serverless:GetDashboardForJobRun in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create dashboard links.\nOpen the Airflow user interface for your task. The Spark user interface and history server dashboard options will appear on the Details tab, as shown in the following screenshot.\nThe screenshot illustrates the Jobs tab of the Spark UI.\nAbout the authors Amit Maindola is a Senior Data Architect focused on data engineering, analytics, and AI/ML at Amazon Web Services.

AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service): Handles asynchronous notifications. AWS Secrets Manager: Secure storage, management, and rotation of secrets. AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, \u0026amp; CodeGuru: CodePipeline/CodeBuild: Building and automating the CI/CD process. CodeBuild runs automated tests and Static Application Security Testing (SAST). AWS CodeGuru: Automated source code analysis tool, integrated into the CI/CD process to provide intelligent recommendations for performance optimization and code quality improvement, especially important in the Lambda environment. AWS CloudFormation: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service for deploying all resources. AWS CloudWatch Logs \u0026amp; AWS X-Ray: CloudWatch Logs collects logs. CloudWatch uses this data to set up alerts. AWS X-Ray provides in-depth request tracing capabilities. Component Design User Interface Layer (Frontend):\nInterface: Next.js application built as static files. Hosting \u0026amp; Distribution: Static files are securely stored in Amazon S3 (configured as Origin for CloudFront). This interface is distributed globally by Amazon CloudFront with low latency, while being protected by AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) at the Edge layer. Business Logic Layer (Backend):\nAPI Gateway: Amazon API Gateway receives all requests. It is configured with Cognito Authorizer to validate user tokens before forwarding requests. Processing: Lambda Functions are responsible for handling business logic (CRUD tasks, team management, permissions). Secret Management: Each Lambda function accesses sensitive information (such as external API keys) through AWS Secrets Manager, ensuring secrets are never hard-coded. Data Layer (Database):\nDatabase: Amazon DynamoDB is used to store task data, progress, and user configuration. DynamoDB operates in On-Demand mode for automatic scaling and cost optimization. Data Security: All data at rest in DynamoDB is encrypted using keys managed by AWS KMS (Key Management Service), meeting the highest security standards. Security and Authentication:\nAuthentication: Amazon Cognito provides login mechanisms, session management, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for users. Cognito also supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and SSO (Single Sign-On) integration. Edge Protection: AWS WAF is placed in front of CloudFront to prevent Layer 7 DDoS attacks and other common security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10). Deployment and Monitoring:\nCI/CD DevSecOps: Source code is stored on GitLab (as per the diagram) and automated via the AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild chain. This process includes running CodeGuru to optimize code before deploying infrastructure via CloudFormation. Monitoring \u0026amp; Debugging: AWS CloudWatch Logs collects detailed logs from all services. AWS CloudWatch uses these logs to set up automatic alerts for errors or incidents. AWS X-Ray provides an overview of transaction flow performance, aiding in debugging and latency optimization. 4. Technical Implementation The development of the TaskHub project is divided into two main parts—building the AWS serverless infrastructure and developing the task management platform—each including the following key implementation phases:\nDeclared Development Phases\nPhase 1: Design and Modeling (Month 1)\nMain Action: Research Serverless/DevSecOps, select core services (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway). Design detailed architecture diagrams and NoSQL data models. Deliverables: Architecture Diagram and Data Model Documentation. Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code Initialization (Month 2)\nMain Action: Calculate detailed operating costs. Use AWS CDK to build IaC source code for platform services (S3, CloudFront, Cognito), ensuring environment reproducibility. Deliverables: Base AWS CDK source code and Operating Cost Report. Phase 3: DevSecOps Automation Setup (Month 2-3)\nMain Action: Set up a complete CI/CD Pipeline (CodePipeline/CodeBuild). Integrate AWS CodeGuru and SAST tools to automate source code quality and security checks before deployment. Deliverables: Operational CodePipeline and automated security scanning process. Phase 4: Development and Deployment (Month 3-4)\nMain Action: Develop functionality (Lambda Functions with TypeScript) and interface (Next.js). Perform Integration Testing between services. Deploy the official production release via Pipeline. Deliverables: TaskHub Beta Version (complete CRUD) and Testing Report. Technical Requirements\nArchitecture and Tools: The entire system is declared and managed using AWS CDK to ensure infrastructure consistency. Technology: Backend uses TypeScript/Node.js. Frontend uses Next.js (React). Source Code Management: Source code on GitLab, automated deployment via AWS CodePipeline. Monitoring: Configure CloudWatch, X-Ray, and CloudWatch Logs for performance monitoring and in-depth debugging. Non-functional Requirements: The system is located in Singapore (ap-southeast-1) to optimize speed in Vietnam, capable of scaling up to 50 users, and uses AWS KMS for data encryption. 5.

Access to accurate data is often the true differentiator between excellent decisions and timely decisions. This becomes even more critical for customer-facing decisions and actions. A modern AI deployed correctly can help your organization simplify data access to make accurate and timely decisions for customer-facing business teams, while minimizing the undifferentiated heavy lifting that your data team has to do. In this post, we share how Parcel Perform, a leading AI Delivery Experience platform for global ecommerce businesses, has implemented such a solution.\nAccurate post-purchase deliveries tracking can be crucial for many ecommerce merchants. Parcel Perform provides an AI-driven, intelligent end-to-end data and delivery experience and software as a service (SaaS) system for ecommerce merchants. The system uses AWS services and state-of-the-art AI to process hundreds of millions of daily parcel delivery movement data and provide a unified tracking capability across couriers for the merchants, with emphasis on accuracy and simplicity.\nThe business team in Parcel Perform often needs access to data to answer questions related to merchants’ parcel deliveries, such as “Did we see a spike in delivery delays last week? If so, in which transit facilities were this observed, and what was the primary cause of the issue?” Previously, the data team had to manually form the query and run it to fetch the data. With the new generative AI-powered text-to-SQL capability in Parcel Perform, the business team can self-serve their data needs by using an AI assistant interface. In this post, we discuss how Parcel Perform incorporated generative AI, data storage, and data access through AWS services to make timely decisions.\nData analytics architecture The solution starts with data ingestion, storage, and access. Parcel Perform adopts a data analytics architecture as shown in the following diagram.\nOne key data type in the Parcel Perform parcel monitoring application is the parcel event data, which can reach billions of rows. This includes the parcel’s shipment status change, location change, and much more. This day-to-day data from multiple business units lands in relational databases hosted on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS).\nAlthough relational databases are suitable for rapid data ingestion and consumption from the application, a separate analytics stack is needed to handle analytics in a scalable and performant way without disrupting the main application. These analytics needs include answering aggregation queries from questions like “How many parcels were delayed last week?”\nParcel Perform uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) with a query engine provided by Amazon Athena to meet their analytics needs. With this approach, Parcel Perform benefits from cost-effective storage while still being able to run SQL queries as needed on the data through Athena, which is priced on usage.\nData in Amazon S3 is stored in Apache Iceberg data format that allows data updates, which is useful in this case because the parcel events sometimes get updated. It also supports partitioning for better performance Amazon S3 Tables, launched in late 2024, is a feature for managing Iceberg tables, and could also be an option for you.\nParcel Perform uses an Apache Kafka cluster managed by Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) as a stream to transfer data from source to S3 bucket. Amazon MSK Connect with Debezium connector streams data using change data capture (CDC) from Amazon RDS to Amazon MSK.\nApache Flink, running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), processes the data streams from Amazon MSK. It writes this data to the S3 bucket in Iceberg format, and updates the data schema in AWS Glue Data Catalog. This data schema allows Athena to query the correct data in the S3 bucket.\nNow that you understand how data is ingested and stored, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at how data is consumed through a data serving assistant using generative AI for business teams at Parcel Perform.\nData-queryable AI agent The users of the data serving AI agent at Parcel Perform are customer-facing business team members who regularly query parcel event data to answer questions from ecommerce merchants about deliveries and support them proactively. The following screenshot shows the AI assistant UI experience, powered by text-to-SQL with generative AI.\nThis functionality helped the Parcel Perform team and their customers save time, which we discuss later in this post. In the following section, we present the architecture that powers this feature.\nText-to-SQL AI agent architecture The data serving AI assistant architecture in Parcel Perform is shown in the following diagram.\nThe AI assistant UI is supported by an application built with the FastAPI framework hosted on Amazon EKS. It is also fronted by an Application Load Balancer to allow for potential horizontal scalability.\nThe application uses LangGraph to orchestrate the workflow of large language model (LLM) calls, tool usage, and memory checkpointing. The graph uses multiple tools, including tools from the SQLDatabase Toolkit to automatically retrieve data schema through Athena. The graph also uses an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases retriever to retrieve business information from a knowledge base. Parcel Perform uses Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s Claude models in Amazon Bedrock to generate SQL.\nAlthough the function of Athena as a query engine to query the parcel event data on Amazon S3 is clear, Parcel Perform still needs a knowledge base. In this use case, the SQL generation performs better when the LLM has more business contextual information to help interpret database fields and translate logistics terminology into data representations. This is better illustrated with the following two examples:\nParcel Perform’s data lake operations use specific codes c for create and u for update. When analyzing data, Parcel Perform sometimes needs to focus only on initial creation records, where operation code is equal to c. Because this business logic might not be inherent in the training of LLMs in general, Parcel Perform explicitly defines this in their business context.\nIn logistics terminology, transit time has specific industry conventions. It’s measured in days, and same-day deliveries are recorded as transit_time = 0. Although this is intuitive for logistics professionals, an LLM might incorrectly interpret a request like “Get me all shipments with same-day delivery” by usingWHERE transit_time = 1 instead of WHERE transit_time = 0 in the generated SQL.\nTherefore, each incoming question goes to a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow to find potentially relevant stored business information, to enrich the context. This mechanism helps provide the specific rules and interpretations that even advanced LLMs might not be able to derive from general training data.\nParcel Perform uses Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases as a managed solution for the RAG workflow. They ingest business context information by uploading files to Amazon S3. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases processes the files, chunks them, uses embedding models to create vectors, and stores the vectors in a vector database so they can be searched. These steps are fully managed by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. Parcel Perform stores the vectors in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless as the chosen vector database to simplify infrastructure management.\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides the Retrieve API, which takes in an input (such as a question from the AI assistant), converts it into a vector embedding, searches for relevant chunks of business context information in the vector database, and returns the top relevant document chunks. It is integrated with the LangChain Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases retriever by calling the invoke method.\nThe next step involves invoking an AI agent with the supplied business contextual information and the SQL generation prompt. The prompt was inspired by a prompt in LangChain Hub. The following is a code snippet of the prompt:\nYou are an agent designed to interact with a SQL database. Given an input question, create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer. Unless the user specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at most {top_k} results. Relevant context: {rag_context} You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database. Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for the relevant columns given the question. You have access to tools for interacting with the database. - Only use the below tools. Only use the information returned by the below tools to construct your final answer. - DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the database. - To start querying for final answer you should ALWAYS look at the tables in the database to see what you can query. Do NOT skip this step. - Then you should query the schema of the most relevant tables The prompt sample is part of the initial instruction for the agent. The data schema is automatically inserted by the tools from the SQLDatabase Toolkit at a later step of this agentic workflow. The following steps occur after a user enters a question in the AI assistant UI:\nThe question triggers a LangGraph execution run.\nThe following processes happen in parallel: a. The graph fetches the database schema from Athena through SQLDatabase Toolkit. b. The graph passes the question to the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases retriever and gets a list of relevant business information regarding the question.\nThe graph invokes an LLM using Amazon Bedrock by passing the question, the conversation context, data schema, and business context information. The result is the generated SQL.\nThe graph uses the SQLDatabase Toolkit again to run the SQL through Athena and receive data results.\nThe data output is passed into an LLM to generate the final response based on the initial question asked. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is used as a safeguard to avoid inappropriate inputs and responses.\nThe final response is returned to the user through the AI assistant UI.\nThe following diagram illustrates these steps.\nThis implementation demonstrates how Parcel Perform transforms raw inquiries into actionable data for timely decision-making. Security is also implemented in multiple components. From a network perspective, the EKS pods are placed in private subnets in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to improve network security of the AI assistant application. This AI agent is placed behind a backend layer that requires authentication. For data security, sensitive data is masked at rest in the S3 bucket. Parcel Perform also limits the permissions of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role used to access the S3 bucket so it can only access certain tables.\nIn the following sections, we discuss how Parcel Perform approached building this data transformation solution.\nFrom idea to production Parcel Perform started with the idea of freeing their data team from manually serving the request from the business team, while also improving the timeliness of the data availability to support the business team’s decision-making.\nWith the help of the AWS Solutions Architect team, Parcel Perform completed a proof of concept using AWS services and a Jupyter notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio. After an initial success, Parcel Perform integrated the solution with their orchestration tool of choice, LangGraph.\nBefore going into production, Parcel Perform conducted thorough testing to verify result consistency. They added LangSmith Tracing to record the steps and results of the AI agent to evaluate its performance.\nThe Parcel Perform team discovered challenges during their journey, which we discuss in the following section. They performed prompt engineering to address those challenges. Eventually, the AI agent was integrated into production to be used by the business team. Afterward, Parcel Perform collected user feedback internally and monitored logs from LangSmith Tracing to verify performance was maintained.\nChallenges This journey was not immune to challenges.\nThis journey isn’t free from challenges. Firstly, some ecommerce merchants might have several records in the data lake under various names. For example, a merchant with the name “ABC” might have multiple records such, as “ABC Singapore Holdings Pte. Ltd.,” “ABC Demo Account,” “ABC Test Group,” and so on. For a question like “Was there any parcel shipment delay by ABC last week?”, the generated SQL has the element of WHERE merchant_name LIKE '%ABC%' which might result in ambiguity. During the proof of concept stage, this problem caused incorrect matching of the result.\nFor this challenge, Parcel Perform relies on careful prompt engineering to instruct the LLM to identify when the name was potentially ambiguous. The AI agent then calls Athena again to look for matching names. The LLM decides which merchant name to use based on multiple factors, including the significance in data volume contribution and the account status in the data lake. In the future, Parcel Perform intends to implement a more sophisticated technique by prompting the user to resolve the ambiguity.\nThe second challenge is about unrestricted questions that might yield expensive queries running across large amounts of data and resulting in longer query waiting time. Some of these questions might not have a LIMIT clause imposed in the query. To solve this, Parcel Perform instructs the LLM to add a LIMIT clause with a certain number of maximum results if the user doesn’t specify the intended number of results. In the future, Parcel Perform plans to use the query EXPLAIN results to identify heavy queries.\nThe third challenge is related to tracking usage and incurred cost of this particular solution. Having started multiple generative AI projects using Amazon Bedrock and sometimes with the same LLM ID, Parcel Perform must distinguish usage incurred by projects. Parcel Perform creates an inference profile for each project, associates the profile with tags, and includes that profile in each LLM call for that project. With this setup, Parcel Perform is able to segregate costs based on projects to improve cost visibility and monitoring.\nThe impact To extract data, the business team clarifies details with the data team, makes a request, checks feasibility, and waits for bandwidth. This process lengthens when requirements come from customers or teams in different time zones, with each clarification adding 12–24 hours due to asynchronous communication. Simpler requests made early in the workday might complete within 24 hours, whereas more complex requests or those during busy periods can take 3–5 business days.\nWith the text-to-SQL AI agent, this process is dramatically streamlined—minimizing the back-and-forth communication for requirement clarification, removing the dependency on data team bandwidth, and automating result interpretation.\nParcel Perform’s measurements show that the text-to-SQL AI agent reduces the average time-to-insight by 99%, from 2.3 days to an average of 10 minutes, saving approximately 3,850 total hours of wait time per month across requesters while maintaining data accuracy.\nUsers can directly query the data without intermediaries, receiving results in minutes rather than days. Teams across time zones can now access insights any time of day, alleviating the frustrating “wait until Asia wakes up” or “catch EMEA before they leave” delays, leading to happier customers and faster problem-solving.\nThis transformation has profoundly impacted the data analytics team’s capacity and focus, freeing the data team for more strategic work and helping everyone make faster, more informed decisions. Before, the analysts spent approximately 25% of their working hours handling routine data extraction requests—equivalent to over 260 hours monthly across the team. Now, with basic and intermediate queries automated, this number has dropped to just 10%, freeing up nearly 160 hours each month for high-impact work. Analysts now focus on complex data analysis rather than spending time on basic data retrieval tasks.\nConclusion Parcel Perform’s solution demonstrates how you can use generative AI to enhance productivity and customer experience. Parcel Perform has built a text-to-SQL AI agent that transforms a business team’s question into SQL that can fetch the actual data. This improves the timeliness of data availability for decision-making that involves customers. Furthermore, the data team can avoid the undifferentiated heavy lifting to focus on complex data analysis tasks.\nThis solution uses multiple AWS services like Amazon Bedrock and tools like LangGraph. You can start with a proof of concept and consult your AWS Solutions Architect or engage with AWS Partners. If you have questions, post them on AWS re:Post. You can also make the development more straightforward with the help of Amazon Q Developer. When you face challenges, you can iterate to find the solution, which might include prompt engineering or adding additional steps to your workflow.\nSecurity is a top priority. Make sure your AI assistant has proper guardrails in place to protect against prompt threats, inappropriate topics, profanity, leaked data, and other security issues. You can integrate Amazon Bedrock Guardrails with your generative AI application through an API.To learn more, refer to the following resources:\nBuild a robust text-to-SQL solution generating complex queries, self-correcting, and querying diverse data sources Xây dựng giải pháp chuyển đổi văn bản sang SQL mạnh mẽ, tạo ra các truy vấn phức tạp, tự động sửa lỗi và truy vấn các nguồn dữ liệu đa dạng LangGraph agents with Amazon Bedrock workshop Build a knowledge base by connecting to a structured data store About the authors Yudho Ahmad Diponegoro is a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS.

One particularly exciting development is the emergence of video generation capabilities, which offer unprecedented opportunities for companies across diverse industries. This technology allows for the creation of short video clips that can be seamlessly combined to produce longer, more complex videos. The potential applications of this innovation are vast and far-reaching, promising to transform how businesses communicate, market, and engage with their audiences. Video generation technology presents a myriad of use cases for companies looking to enhance their visual content strategies. For instance, ecommerce businesses can use this technology to create dynamic product demonstrations, showcasing items from multiple angles and in various contexts without the need for extensive physical photoshoots. In the realm of education and training, organizations can generate instructional videos tailored to specific learning objectives, quickly updating content as needed without re-filming entire sequences. Marketing teams can craft personalized video advertisements at scale, targeting different demographics with customized messaging and visuals. Furthermore, the entertainment industry stands to benefit greatly, with the ability to rapidly prototype scenes, visualize concepts, and even assist in the creation of animated content. The flexibility offered by combining these generated clips into longer videos opens up even more possibilities. Companies can create modular content that can be quickly rearranged and repurposed for different displays, audiences, or campaigns. This adaptability not only saves time and resources, but also allows for more agile and responsive content strategies. As we delve deeper into the potential of video generation technology, it becomes clear that its value extends far beyond mere convenience, offering a transformative tool that can drive innovation, efficiency, and engagement across the corporate landscape.\nIn this post, we explore how to implement a robust AWS-based solution for video generation that uses the CogVideoX model and Amazon SageMaker AI.\nSolution overview Our architecture delivers a highly scalable and secure video generation solution using AWS managed services. The data management layer implements three purpose-specific Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets—for input videos, processed outputs, and access logging—each configured with appropriate encryption and lifecycle policies to support data security throughout its lifecycle.\nFor compute resources, we use AWS Fargate for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to host the Streamlit web application, providing serverless container management with automatic scaling capabilities. Traffic is efficiently distributed through an Application Load Balancer. The AI processing pipeline uses SageMaker AI processing jobs to handle video generation tasks, decoupling intensive computation from the web interface for cost optimization and enhanced maintainability. User prompts are refined through Amazon Bedrock, which feeds into the CogVideoX-5b model for high-quality video generation, creating an end-to-end solution that balances performance, security, and cost-efficiency.\nThe following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.\nSolution overview CogVideoX is an open source, state-of-the-art text-to-video generation model capable of producing 10-second continuous videos at 16 frames per second with a resolution of 768×1360 pixels. The model effectively translates text prompts into coherent video narratives, addressing common limitations in previous video generation systems.\nThe model uses three key innovations:\nA 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that compresses videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, improving compression efficiency and video quality An expert transformer with adaptive LayerNorm that enhances text-to-video alignment through deeper fusion between modalities Progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack techniques that enable the creation of longer, coherent videos with significant motion elements CogVideoX also benefits from an effective text-to-video data processing pipeline with various preprocessing strategies and a specialized video captioning method, contributing to higher generation quality and better semantic alignment. The model’s weights are publicly available, making it accessible for implementation in various business applications, such as product demonstrations and marketing content. The following diagram shows the architecture of the model. Prompt enhancement To improve the quality of video generation, the solution provides an option to enhance user-provided prompts. This is done by instructing a large language model (LLM), in this case Anthropic’s Claude, to take a user’s initial prompt and expand upon it with additional details, creating a more comprehensive description for video creation. The prompt consists of three parts:\nRole section – Defines the AI’s purpose in enhancing prompts for video generation Task section – Specifies the instructions needed to be performed with the original prompt Prompt section – Where the user’s original input is inserted By adding more descriptive elements to the original prompt, this system aims to provide richer, more detailed instructions to video generation models, potentially resulting in more accurate and visually appealing video outputs. We use the following prompt template for this solution: \u0026lt;Role\u0026gt; Your role is to enhance the user prompt that is given to you by providing additional details to the prompt. The end goal is to covert the user prompt into a short video clip, so it is necessary to provide as much information you can. \u0026lt;/Role\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Task\u0026gt; You must add details to the user prompt in order to enhance it for video generation. You must provide a 1 paragraph response. No more and no less. Only include the enhanced prompt in your response. Do not include anything else. \u0026lt;/Task\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Prompt\u0026gt; {prompt} \u0026lt;/Prompt\u0026gt; Prerequisites Before you deploy the solution, make sure you have the following prerequisites:\nThe AWS CDK Toolkit – Install the AWS CDK Toolkit globally using npm: npm install -g aws-cdk This provides the core functionality for deploying infrastructure as code to AWS. Docker Desktop – This is required for local development and testing. It makes sure container images can be built and tested locally before deployment. The AWS CLI – The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) must be installed and configured with appropriate credentials. This requires an AWS account with necessary permissions. Configure the AWS CLI using aws configure with your access key and secret. Python Environment – You must have Python 3.11+ installed on your system. We recommend using a virtual environment for isolation. This is required for both the AWS CDK infrastructure and Streamlit application. Active AWS account – You will need to raise a service quota request for SageMaker to ml.g5.4xlarge for processing jobs. Deploy the solution This solution has been tested in the us-east-1 AWS Region. Complete the following steps to deploy:\nCreate and activate a virtual environment: python -m venv .` venv source .venv/bin/activate Install infrastructure dependencies: cd infrastructure pip install -r requirements.txt Bootstrap the AWS CDK (if not already done in your AWS account): cdk bootstrap Deploy the infrastructure: cdk deploy -c allowed_ips=\u0026#39;[\u0026#34;\u0026#39;$(curl -s ifconfig.me)\u0026#39;/32\u0026#34;]\u0026#39; To access the Streamlit UI, choose the link for StreamlitURL in the AWS CDK output logs after deployment is successful. The following screenshot shows the Streamlit UI accessible through the URL.\nBasic video generation Complete the following steps to generate a video:\nInput your natural language prompt into the text box at the top of the page. Copy this prompt to the text box at the bottom. Choose Generate Video to create a video using this basic prompt. The following is the output from the simple prompt “A bee on a flower.” Enhanced video generation For higher-quality results, complete the following steps:\nEnter your initial prompt in the top text box. Choose Enhance Prompt to send your prompt to Amazon Bedrock. Wait for Amazon Bedrock to expand your prompt into a more descriptive version. Review the enhanced prompt that appears in the lower text box. Edit the prompt further if desired. Choose Generate Video to initiate the processing job with CogVideoX. When processing is complete, your video will appear on the page with a download option.The following is an example of an enhanced prompt and output:\n\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; A vibrant yellow and black honeybee gracefully lands on a large, blooming sunflower in a lush garden on a warm summer day. The bee\u0026#39;s fuzzy body and delicate wings are clearly visible as it moves methodically across the flower\u0026#39;s golden petals, collecting pollen. Sunlight filters through the petals, creating a soft, warm glow around the scene. The bee\u0026#39;s legs are coated in pollen as it works diligently, its antennae twitching occasionally. In the background, other colorful flowers sway gently in a light breeze, while the soft buzzing of nearby bees can be heard \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Add an image to your prompt If you want to include an image with your text prompt, complete the following steps:\n1.Complete the text prompt and optional enhancement steps. 2. Choose Include an Image. 3. Upload the photo you want to use. 4. With both text and image now prepared, choose Generate Video to start the processing job.\nThe following is an example of the previous enhanced prompt with an included image.\nTo view more samples, check out the CogVideoX gallery.\nClean up To avoid incurring ongoing charges, clean up the resources you created as part of this post:\ncdk destroy\nConsiderations Although our current architecture serves as an effective proof of concept, several enhancements are recommended for a production environment. Considerations include implementing an API Gateway with AWS Lambda backed REST endpoints for improved interface and authentication, introducing a queue-based architecture using Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) for better job management and reliability, and enhancing error handling and monitoring capabilities.\nConclusion Video generation technology has emerged as a transformative force in digital content creation, as demonstrated by our comprehensive AWS-based solution using the CogVideoX model.

A data lake is a centralized, managed, and secure repository to store all your data, both in its raw and processed forms for analysis. Data lakes allow you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and make better business decisions.\nThis blog post is part of a larger series on getting started with setting up a healthcare data lake. In my final post of the series, “Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Diving into Amazon Cognito”, I focused on the specifics of using Amazon Cognito and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to authenticate and authorize users in the healthcare data lake solution. In this blog, I detail how the solution evolved at a foundational level, including the design decisions I made and the additional features used. You can access the code samples for the solution in this Git repo for reference.\nArchitecture Guidance The main change since the last presentation of the overall architecture is the decomposition of a single service into a set of smaller services to improve maintainability and flexibility. Integrating a large volume of diverse healthcare data often requires specialized connectors for each format; by keeping them encapsulated separately as microservices, we can add, remove, and modify each connector without affecting the others. The microservices are loosely coupled via publish/subscribe messaging centered in what I call the “pub/sub hub.”\nThis solution represents what I would consider another reasonable sprint iteration from my last post. The scope is still limited to the ingestion and basic parsing of HL7v2 messages formatted in Encoding Rules 7 (ER7) through a REST interface.\nThe solution architecture is now as follows:\nFigure 1. Overall architecture; colored boxes represent distinct services.\nWhile the term microservices has some inherent ambiguity, certain traits are common:\nSmall, autonomous, loosely coupled Reusable, communicating through well-defined interfaces Specialized to do one thing well Often implemented in an event-driven architecture When determining where to draw boundaries between microservices, consider:\nIntrinsic: technology used, performance, reliability, scalability Extrinsic: dependent functionality, rate of change, reusability Human: team ownership, managing cognitive load Technology Choices and Communication Scope Communication scope Technologies / patterns to consider Within a single microservice Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Step Functions Between microservices in a single service AWS CloudFormation cross-stack references, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) Between services Amazon EventBridge, AWS Cloud Map, Amazon API Gateway The Pub/Sub Hub Using a hub-and-spoke architecture (or message broker) works well with a small number of tightly related microservices.\nEach microservice depends only on the hub Inter-microservice connections are limited to the contents of the published message Reduces the number of synchronous calls since pub/sub is a one-way asynchronous push Drawback: coordination and monitoring are needed to avoid microservices processing the wrong message.\nCore Microservice Provides foundational data and communication layer, including:\nAmazon S3 bucket for data Amazon DynamoDB for data catalog AWS Lambda to write messages into the data lake and catalog Amazon SNS topic as the hub Amazon S3 bucket for artifacts such as Lambda code Only allow indirect write access to the data lake through a Lambda function → ensures consistency.\nFront Door Microservice Provides an API Gateway for external REST interaction Authentication \u0026amp; authorization based on OIDC via Amazon Cognito Self-managed deduplication mechanism using DynamoDB instead of SNS FIFO because: SNS deduplication TTL is only 5 minutes SNS FIFO requires SQS FIFO Ability to proactively notify the sender that the message is a duplicate Staging ER7 Microservice Lambda “trigger” subscribed to the pub/sub hub, filtering messages by attribute Step Functions Express Workflow to convert ER7 → JSON Two Lambdas: Fix ER7 formatting (newline, carriage return) Parsing logic Result or error is pushed back into the pub/sub hub New Features in the Solution 1.

S3 Bucket 1 Configuration: taskhub-frontend-prod (Frontend Origin) This Bucket serves as the Origin for CloudFront, storing Frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS) and static assets.\n1.1. Access and Bucket Creation Log in to the AWS Console, find and select the Amazon S3 service. Click the \u0026ldquo;Create bucket\u0026rdquo; button. Fill in the general configuration information: Configuration Value Explanation Bucket name taskhub-frontend-prod The Bucket name must be globally unique. AWS Region Asia Pacific (Singapore) ap-southeast-1 Select the geographical region closest to the target users to optimize latency. 1.2. Object Ownership \u0026amp; Public Access Configuration Object Ownership: Select ACLs disabled (recommended). Purpose: Access permissions are managed centrally using a Bucket Policy, simplifying management. Block Public Access settings for this bucket: Action: Uncheck [ ] Block all public access (and all sub-options). Reason: This allows us to configure a Bucket Policy later to grant read-only access specifically to CloudFront OAC (Origin Access Control), ensuring S3 can function as a valid private Origin. 1.3. Versioning and Encryption Configuration Configuration Value Explanation Bucket Versioning Select: Disable Reduces Storage Costs as maintaining multiple versions of Frontend code is unnecessary. Default encryption Enable Ensures data is encrypted when stored (at rest). Encryption type Select: Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) The default, cost-effective encryption method. Bucket Key Select: Enable Minimizes Request Costs related to the encryption/decryption process. 2. S3 Bucket 2 Configuration: taskhub-files-prod (User Files Storage) This Bucket is used to store files uploaded by users (images, media\u0026hellip;). Maximum security is prioritized. The creation process is similar to the S3 Bucket above.\n2.1. Access and Bucket Creation Repeat the Bucket creation steps (Section 1.1). Bucket name: taskhub-files-prod AWS Region: Asia Pacific (Singapore) ap-southeast-1 2.2. Public Access Configuration (SECURITY DIFFERENCE) Block Public Access settings for this bucket: Keep [X] Block all public access (CHECK ALL). Reason: This is a Secure Bucket containing user data. Files MUST NOT be publicly accessible. Access will only be temporarily granted via Pre-signed URLs generated by the Backend API after authentication. 2.3. Versioning and Encryption Configuration (Similar) Configuration Value Explanation Bucket Versioning Select: Disable Prevents rapid storage cost increases when users update/delete files. Default encryption Enable Data encryption is mandatory for user data. Encryption type Select: Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) Standard S3 encryption. Bucket Key Select: Enable Reduces encryption request costs.

S3 PREREQUISITES CHECK Before finalizing CloudFront setup, you must ensure the S3 Bucket taskhub-frontend-prod is protected and configured correctly.\n1.1. Static Website Hosting Status Check: The Properties tab of the S3 Bucket. Status: S3 static website hosting must be in the Disabled state. Explanation: Since CloudFront acts as the CDN, Static Website Hosting is not required on S3. S3 merely serves as the content repository (Origin). 1.2. Block Public Access \u0026amp; Bucket Policy Check: The Permissions tab of the S3 Bucket. Block public access (bucket settings): Must be in the On state (Block all public access). Bucket policy (Final Confirmation): Must contain the OAC Policy that is automatically updated by CloudFront. 2. CLOUDFRONT DISTRIBUTION CONFIGURATION 2.1. Step 1 \u0026amp; 2: Get started Configuration Value Explanation Action Click \u0026ldquo;Create distribution\u0026rdquo;. Start the CDN creation process. Plan Select Free Plan ($0/month). The free plan for the project. Distribution name taskhub-frontend-cdn A memorable name for the resource. Distribution type Single website or app. The appropriate type for a Frontend application. 2.2. Step 3: Specify origin (OAC Setup) 1. Specify Origin Origin type: Select Amazon S3. S3 origin: Select the S3 Bucket taskhub-frontend-prod. 2. Configure OAC (Automatic Security) 1. Tick \u0026ldquo;Allow private S3 bucket access to CloudFront - Recommended\u0026rdquo;. 2. Select Use recommended origin settings. * Explanation: Upon completing the Distribution creation, CloudFront will automatically update the S3 Bucket Policy to grant access via OAC.\n3. Cache Configuration Cache settings: Select Use recommended cache settings tailored to serving S3 content. Default Root Object: Enter index.html (Standard configuration for SPA). 2.3. Step 4 \u0026amp; 5: Security \u0026amp; TLS Configuration Applied Value Explanation WAF Uncheck paid features. Keeping defaults for the project. Viewer protocol policy Redirect HTTP to HTTPS Mandates the use of the secure protocol. Custom SSL certificate Default CloudFront Certificate Activates free HTTPS. 2.4. Step 6: Review and create 1. Review Origin (Source Confirmation) S3 origin: taskhub-frontend-prod. (Must ensure the correct Frontend Bucket is selected). Grant CloudFront access to origin: Must be Yes. (Confirms OAC functionality). 2. Final Configuration Price Class: Select Use all edge locations (best performance). Click the \u0026ldquo;Create distribution\u0026rdquo; button to deploy. 3. POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECK: OAC SECURITY CONFIRMATION After the Distribution status changes to Deploying, perform this crucial check to confirm that OAC is functional:\nAccess S3 Bucket taskhub-frontend-prod. Navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Permissions\u0026rdquo; tab. Find the \u0026ldquo;Bucket policy\u0026rdquo; section. Confirm: The Policy must be automatically updated and contain the JSON statement authorizing the CloudFront service. This confirms that OAC has blocked direct access and only allows CloudFront to read the files.

Working Environment The working environment at AWS Vietnam is truly impressive and professional. The modern office at Bitexco Financial Tower creates a sense of pride when working here. FCJ team members are always ready to assist when I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. The atmosphere is dynamic but not stressful, allowing me to maximize my abilities.\n2. Mentor / Admin Team Support The mentor provided very detailed guidance, explained clearly when I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand, and always encouraged me to ask questions. The admin team supported procedures, documentation, and created favorable conditions for my work. I highly appreciate that the mentor allowed me to try and solve problems by myself instead of just providing the answers.\n3. Suitability of Work to Academic Major The tasks I was assigned were suitable for the knowledge I learned at university, while also broadening my exposure to new areas I had not yet accessed. As a result, I both consolidated my foundational knowledge and learned practical skills.\n4. Learning Opportunities \u0026amp; Skill Development This is the point I appreciate the most. I not only learned technical skills but also developed professional skills, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Mr. Hoang Van Kha also shared a lot of practical experience, helping me better orient my career path.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but with joy. When there\u0026rsquo;s an urgent project, everyone works together, providing support regardless of position. This made me feel like I was a part of the collective, even as just an intern.\n6. Intern Policies / Benefits The company provided internship allowance and offered flexibility in working hours when necessary. FCJ members were always ready to answer student questions, even outside of working hours. Furthermore, being able to participate in training workshops was a major plus.\nOther Questions What did you enjoy most during your internship? - The thing that made me most satisfied and fond of the experience was the supportive spirit and professional discipline of all the seniors in the FCJ team. Whenever I faced challenges, I received dedicated guidance, which helped me feel more confident and stable in my work.\nWhat do you think the company needs to improve for subsequent interns? - To help future interns feel more connected and close to each other, as well as to the company culture, I hope the company can enhance networking activities. Specifically, I propose: Organizing meetups for the members within our team so everyone has the opportunity to socialize, get acquainted, and work together more easily. Additionally, if there were more In-depth Training sessions on specific professional areas, it would be very beneficial for our career development orientation.\nIf recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why? - Absolutely YES! I would recommend it immediately. This is an ideal working environment: professional yet incredibly welcoming, with dedicated mentors, and clear work, suitable for developing comprehensive skills, from specialized knowledge to professional conduct.\nProposals \u0026amp; Wishes Do you have any proposals to improve the internship experience? - I propose focusing on community building and networking, specifically:\n* Increasing in-person meetups at the office: As I suggested, small team gatherings would help everyone feel closer, more bonded, and gain a clearer understanding of the company culture and the work itself.\n* Organizing additional experience sharing sessions or internal knowledge sharing among different departments to broaden the interns\u0026rsquo; knowledge and perspective.\nWould you like to continue this program in the future? - I am very eager to continue participating in this program or other company projects in the future, as I truly found a positive working environment and a great opportunity for self-development here.\nOther Feedback (Free sharing): - I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Company and the FCJ Team for creating such wonderful conditions and supporting me wholeheartedly. I hope the internship program will continue to improve, and that my feedback will bring even more value to the future generations of interns!\n"},{"uri":"https://thanhtu18.github.io/workshop-template/5-workshop/5.8-cognito/","title":"Setup AWS Cognito Authentication","tags":[],"description":"","content":"AWS Cognito User Authentication Workshop Overview AWS Cognito provides user identity and access management for web and mobile applications.

A data lake is a centralized, managed, and secure repository to store all your data, both in its raw and processed forms for analysis. Data lakes allow you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and make better business decisions.\nThis blog post is part of a larger series on getting started with setting up a healthcare data lake. In my final post of the series, “Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Diving into Amazon Cognito”, I focused on the specifics of using Amazon Cognito and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to authenticate and authorize users in the healthcare data lake solution. In this blog, I detail how the solution evolved at a foundational level, including the design decisions I made and the additional features used. You can access the code samples for the solution in this Git repo for reference.\nArchitecture Guidance The main change since the last presentation of the overall architecture is the decomposition of a single service into a set of smaller services to improve maintainability and flexibility. Integrating a large volume of diverse healthcare data often requires specialized connectors for each format; by keeping them encapsulated separately as microservices, we can add, remove, and modify each connector without affecting the others. The microservices are loosely coupled via publish/subscribe messaging centered in what I call the “pub/sub hub.”\nThis solution represents what I would consider another reasonable sprint iteration from my last post. The scope is still limited to the ingestion and basic parsing of HL7v2 messages formatted in Encoding Rules 7 (ER7) through a REST interface.\nThe solution architecture is now as follows:\nFigure 1. Overall architecture; colored boxes represent distinct services.\nWhile the term microservices has some inherent ambiguity, certain traits are common:\nSmall, autonomous, loosely coupled Reusable, communicating through well-defined interfaces Specialized to do one thing well Often implemented in an event-driven architecture When determining where to draw boundaries between microservices, consider:\nIntrinsic: technology used, performance, reliability, scalability Extrinsic: dependent functionality, rate of change, reusability Human: team ownership, managing cognitive load Technology Choices and Communication Scope Communication scope Technologies / patterns to consider Within a single microservice Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Step Functions Between microservices in a single service AWS CloudFormation cross-stack references, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) Between services Amazon EventBridge, AWS Cloud Map, Amazon API Gateway The Pub/Sub Hub Using a hub-and-spoke architecture (or message broker) works well with a small number of tightly related microservices.\nEach microservice depends only on the hub Inter-microservice connections are limited to the contents of the published message Reduces the number of synchronous calls since pub/sub is a one-way asynchronous push Drawback: coordination and monitoring are needed to avoid microservices processing the wrong message.\nCore Microservice Provides foundational data and communication layer, including:\nAmazon S3 bucket for data Amazon DynamoDB for data catalog AWS Lambda to write messages into the data lake and catalog Amazon SNS topic as the hub Amazon S3 bucket for artifacts such as Lambda code Only allow indirect write access to the data lake through a Lambda function → ensures consistency.\nFront Door Microservice Provides an API Gateway for external REST interaction Authentication \u0026amp; authorization based on OIDC via Amazon Cognito Self-managed deduplication mechanism using DynamoDB instead of SNS FIFO because: SNS deduplication TTL is only 5 minutes SNS FIFO requires SQS FIFO Ability to proactively notify the sender that the message is a duplicate Staging ER7 Microservice Lambda “trigger” subscribed to the pub/sub hub, filtering messages by attribute Step Functions Express Workflow to convert ER7 → JSON Two Lambdas: Fix ER7 formatting (newline, carriage return) Parsing logic Result or error is pushed back into the pub/sub hub New Features in the Solution 1.
