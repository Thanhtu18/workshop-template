This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

###  [Blog 1 - Develop and monitor a Spark application using existing data in Amazon S3 with Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog explains how to develop and monitor Spark applications in the integrated environment of Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio. You will learn how to address challenges in managing big data analytics, such as fragmented development environments, complex resource management, and inconsistent monitoring. The article details how to set up Serverless EMR, develop Spark applications with the TPC-DS dataset in Jupyter notebooks, monitor performance using the Spark UI, and automate workflows with Amazon MWAA. This unified solution helps data teams focus on analytics instead of managing infrastructure.
